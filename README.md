Hello, I am Anthony, a Software Engineer (in training, legally), graduated from the University of Victoria in 2024.

I have a soft specialization in GIS software development and analysis, and have dipped the toes in other areas like animation, game development, full-stack development and security.

You can send me an email at anthonydavvid@gmail.com if you wanted to reach me for some reason :)
